## Project Overview

The **Adaptive Multi-Fidelity Simulation-Based Optimization for Aerospace Systems** framework represents the culmination of extensive research and development in computational aerospace engineering. This production-ready system achieves **{{ site.achievements.cost_reduction }} computational cost reduction** while maintaining **{{ site.achievements.solution_accuracy }} solution accuracy** through revolutionary adaptive fidelity management.

## Development Background

### The Challenge
Traditional aerospace optimization relies heavily on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which can take hours or days to complete. This computational burden severely limits the exploration of design spaces and practical application of optimization techniques in real-world aerospace projects.

### Our Solution
We developed an intelligent multi-fidelity framework that:
- **Adaptively switches** between simulation fidelities based on optimization progress
- **Maintains solution quality** while dramatically reducing computational costs
- **Provides uncertainty quantification** for robust design under real-world conditions
- **Integrates seamlessly** with existing aerospace design workflows

## Technical Innovation

### Adaptive Fidelity Management
Our breakthrough innovation lies in the intelligent management of simulation fidelities:

```
Low Fidelity (0.1s)    → Fast exploration and screening
Medium Fidelity (3.2s) → Balanced accuracy and speed  
High Fidelity (17.4s)  → Final validation and refinement
```

The framework automatically selects the optimal fidelity level based on:
- Current optimization progress and convergence status
- Solution confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates
- Computational budget and time constraints
- Problem complexity and design space characteristics
